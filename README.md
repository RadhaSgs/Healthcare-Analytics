Healthcare Analytics: Diabetes Prediction 
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to predict diabetes risk and derive actionable insights to improve patient care and resource allocation.

## Files Included
- **Healthcare_Analytics_Script.py**: Python script for data analysis, predictive modeling, and evaluation.
- **Healthcare_Diabetes_Analysis_Report.pdf**: A detailed report summarizing insights and recommendations for stakeholders.
- **Dataset_Placeholder.txt**: Instructions for downloading the dataset from Kaggle.

## How to Use
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle: [Healthcare Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nanditapore/healthcare-diabetes).
2. Save the dataset as `healthcare_diabetes_dataset.csv` in this directory.
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
4. Run the script to generate insights and visualizations:
   ```bash
   python Healthcare_Analytics_Script.py
   ```

## Insights and Recommendations
- **Key Predictors**: Glucose levels, BMI, and age are the most significant factors influencing diabetes risk.
- **Recommendations**:
  1. Implement community-based glucose and BMI screening programs.
  2. Allocate resources to regions with higher diabetes prevalence for early interventions.
  3. Use predictive modeling to proactively monitor high-risk patients.
